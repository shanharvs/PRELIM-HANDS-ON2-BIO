    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;"><b>Shanizza Harvey</b> loves to read books from the very beginning.<sup>1</sup> 
        In her childhood years, around ten or eleven years old, she was already reading books of her sisters which are usually stories from Wattpad. Stories like <i>Diary ng Panget, Teen Clash, and She’s Dating The Gangster</i>; the kind of stories that feels cringe reading today but feels like home every time she stumbles into it.<sup>2</sup> 
        She also likes to watch tagalog animes on TV in peaceful mornings. As a child, she wanted to be an astronaut or a ballerina because she was inspired by cartoons she’s watched.<sup>3</sup> 
        Apart from that, she also likes to go outside and do absolutely everything; playing hide and seek and tumbang preso, be a mother on chinese garter, keeping stones that are small and smooth, collecting pogs and texts.<sup>4</sup>
        At home, oh, she doesn’t like to be at home, like she thinks when going to school.<sup>5</sup>
        Her mother is a bit strict and her sisters are much old than her.<sup>6</sup>
        She’s the seventh of her sisters, you see.<sup>7</sup>
        The sister before her has a nine years age gap between them.<sup>8</sup>
        The only savior in their house is probably her Dad because he loves to spoil her that much and calls her ‘his favorite and beautiful daughter’.<sup>9</sup>
        Her father even went with her to the mall, Ever, which is located in Quezon City.<sup>10</sup>
        She loves that mall very much because of her father.<sup>11</sup>
        She also loves to go to <i>TomsWorld</i> there and try all those arcade games<sup>12</sup>
        And some other times, they will go to Puregold around Quezon City too, and buy pizza.<sup>13</sup>
        She adores it every time her father praises her that she ate almost all the pizza, which is why she tries to eat everything whenever they go there.<sup>14</sup>
        Like a typical child, she discovers she has fears too; she fears heights, falling off the stairs, spiders, and cockroaches.<sup>15</sup>
        She had experienced falling from the stairs and her dad treated her Cornetto to calm her down.<sup>16</sup>
        Honestly, if she could relive one memory in her childhood days, it’s most likely where she had fun with her Dad and his one box of pizza.<sup>17</sup>
        It really was my most fond memories of her childhood.<sup>18</sup>
        She’s a Daddy’s girl, after all.<sup>19</sup>
        She thinks, <q>her childhood is probably one of her most colorful days.</q><sup>20</sup></p>

<h2>Teenage Years</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;"> When was in teenage years, she started to notice time was moving too fast.<sup>1</sup>
         One blink, she’s finally a teenager.<sup>2</sup> 
         At those times, she started having crushes and flirts with random boys at her compound.<sup>3</sup> 
         She went with her nieces, which is around her age too, to go to them and try to get noticed by those boys.<sup>4</sup> 
         She still doesn’t like going to school and notices that she hates Mondays because it’s the first day to attend her classes.<sup>5</sup> 
         She’s a late-night crammer but still passes her quizzes and exams.<sup>6</sup>
         Her favorite subject is Araling Panlipunan, especially when the lessons are all about history.<sup>7</sup>
         She’s good at memorizing if she takes it seriously, you see.<sup>8</sup> 
         During those school days, she met her new two friends, they talked like typical teenage girls and go out to buy street foods after their class.<sup>9</sup>
         She has had a good social life before and it was thrilling. She also discovers how to read on Wattpad online.<sup>10</sup>
         And she guiltily admits that she reads books that were not suitable for her age but she loves it.<sup>11</sup>
         She still reads her sisters’ books behind their backs and imagines herself being the main love interest in those books.<sup>12</sup>
         Her and her sisters are getting along, or maybe she was a brat when she was a child which is why they were not close before.<sup>13</sup>
         And like some teenagers, she unfortunately experienced bullying.<sup>14</sup>
         She was bullied because she sat with one of the boys in her classroom and the girl thinks she likes him.<sup>15</sup>
         It was one of her most traumatic events that happened in her teenage years. Almost every classmate of hers turned their backs on her.<sup>16</sup>
         And one time, she heard one of her favorite teachers in AP call her ‘bangag’ because she has eyebags under her eyes.<sup>17</sup>
         That was the time she realized that even those you look up to are awful and that respect begets respect.<sup>18</sup>
         Those times ruined her teenage years for her.<sup>19</sup>
         Issues from her family had risen then and there.<sup>20</sup> 
         Her Dad also slowly went away and lived in Zamboanga City.<sup>21</sup>
         It was a good thing her family and some of her friends are there to support her in those years and that she graduated with honors in her junior high in <abbr title="Juan Sumulong High School">JSHS</abbr> and graduated with high honor in senior high in <abbr title= "Nazarene Catholic School">NCS</abbr> located in Quiapo, Manila.<sup>22</sup>
         She thinks, <q>her teenage years are is black and white as she experienced terrific happiness and lots of sadness.</q><sup>23</sup></p>

<h2>College Years</h2>
         <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;">Now in her college years, this is the time she doesn’t know what she’s gonna do with her life.<sup>1</sup>
            She doesn’t know what to do in her future and she can’t see herself doing whatsoever.<sup>2</sup>
            She’s in the process of finding herself.<sup>3</sup>
            And honestly, she chose IT as her course because one of her sisters graduated with it and that it’s the most practical option as there are so many jobs that are required in IT because the course itself is broad.<sup>4</sup>
            She’s currently in her second year in this course in University of the East, and one more semester, she will be in her third year.<sup>5</sup>
            She’s hopeful that she knows what she’s doing.<sup>6</sup>
            Even though the course is hard, and cramming is still in her veins, she’s trying to pass everything.<sup>7</sup>
            Honestly speaking, she’s one of those achievers and loves the praises that came from it.<sup>8</sup>
            But now, as long as she passed everything, she’s good to go.<sup>9</sup>
            Every subject sure is hard but in her mind, she could pass through it.<sup>10</sup>
            Her love for books also grew.<sup>11</sup>
            Instead of reading wattpad books which were written in <abbr title="Tagalog and English">TagLish</abbr> she’s now reading full English novels written by various authors across the world.<sup>12</sup>
            It didn’t change the fact that she’s mostly into fiction in romance, fantasy, and historical genres.<sup>13</sup> 
            But she can read different genres if she likes, it really depends on her mood.<sup>14</sup> 
            And that she can now buy books, which she is most proud of, with her own money by saving it for weeks.<sup>15</sup>
            She also made new friends, but mostly boys as this course is more into men's field.<sup>16</sup>
            As for what happens to her after graduation, she still doesn’t know it yet.<sup>17</sup>
            But she’s not panicking that much because her sisters are there for her to help her.<sup>18</sup>
            For her college years and beyond, she thinks, <q>that even though the world is black in white, there are also screaming colors as life goes on no matter what happens, so enjoy it and be proud of it.</q><sup>19</sup>
            No matter how big or small.<sup>20</sup></p>
